# Research Abstract
<p align="center">
- This research project aims to analyze how the south-American regionalism reacts to crisis scenarios within the perspective of the regional infrastructure initiatives in South America. Since 2013 the relations between the south-American countries are pervaded by conflicts and dissatisfaction, achieving its apex with the dismantling of UNASUR in 2019. Yet, in the opposite way of the crisis deepening, the regional infrastructure initiatives had a constancy of efforts during the same period, demonstrating a high level of interests for its continuity and in executing its projects as well as in attracting investments to the continent. However, even with the institutional development of the infrastructure integration there hasn’t been a search for alternatives to diminish regional mechanisms vulnerability when facing regional crises. In addition, the national logic has been prioritized in the detriment of investing in the regional dynamic. In the other hand, it is argued that this strategy has resulted in a bigger vulnerability in the instituted arrangement, mainly during political and economic national crisis, when there is higher level of retraction of the existent regional spaces. Hence, the built scenario pave the way for a growing participation of extraregional interests like those from the United States and China, which do not necessarily aim for surpassing the socioeconomic problems that are present in each south-American country.
